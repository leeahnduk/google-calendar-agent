# üß™ Google Chat Test Setup Guide

## Problem Diagnosis

Your "Grab ADK" space isn't being detected because the Google Chat detection logic requires specific conditions to be met.

## ‚úÖ How to Set Up Google Chat for Testing

### **Step 1: Create Meeting with Matching Title**

In Google Calendar, create a test meeting with a title that matches your chat space:

**Good Examples:**
- Meeting title: `"Grab ADK Planning Meeting"`
- Meeting title: `"ADK Project Discussion"`  
- Meeting title: `"Grab Team Sync"`

**Why this works:**
- Title contains "Grab" or "ADK" which matches your space name
- Agent extracts keywords from meeting title and matches them to space names

### **Step 2: Set Up Google Chat Space Properly**

**Option A: Use Your Existing Space**
- Keep space name: `"Grab ADK"`
- Make sure your meeting title contains either "Grab" or "ADK" 

**Option B: Create New Space (Recommended for Testing)**
- Create space name: `"ADK Project Discussion"`
- Create meeting title: `"ADK Project Discussion Meeting"`
- This ensures perfect keyword matching

### **Step 3: Add Proper Chat Messages**

The agent looks for messages that are:
- ‚úÖ **Recent** (within last 7 days)
- ‚úÖ **Relevant** (contain meeting keywords OR longer than 10 characters)

**Good Test Messages:**
```
User 1: "Hey, are we ready for the ADK project meeting tomorrow?"
User 2: "Yes, I've prepared the presentation. Should we discuss the timeline?"
User 1: "Definitely. I think we need to review the requirements first."
User 2: "Agreed. I'll share the document in the meeting."
```

**Why these work:**
- Contain meeting keywords ("ADK", "meeting", "project")
- Are longer than 10 characters
- Are recent (last 7 days)

### **Step 4: Add Meeting Attendees**

Make sure both chat participants are also **meeting attendees**:
- Add both Google Chat users to your calendar meeting
- Agent searches for chats involving meeting attendees

### **Step 5: Test Message Types**

The agent checks **ALL** types of spaces:
- ‚úÖ **Direct Messages (DMs)**: Automatically included
- ‚úÖ **Group Spaces**: Must match meeting title keywords
- ‚úÖ **Named Spaces**: Must contain meeting keywords in the space name

## üîß **Quick Test Setup**

Here's a foolproof test setup:

### **1. Create Calendar Meeting:**
```
Title: "ADK Project Planning"
Attendees: [your email] and [another participant email]
Date: Today or tomorrow
```

### **2. Create/Rename Google Chat Space:**
```
Space Name: "ADK Project Planning" 
(exact match with meeting title)
```

### **3. Send Test Messages:**
```
Message 1: "Ready for the ADK project planning meeting?"
Message 2: "Yes, let's discuss the timeline and requirements."
Message 3: "I'll prepare the presentation beforehand."
```

### **4. Run Meeting Prep:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes after creating messages
- Run the meeting prep agent
- Should now detect and analyze the chat messages

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Still No Chat Detection**

**Check These:**

1. **OAuth Re-authorization:**
   ```bash
   # Verify scopes include Google Chat
   cd /Users/anhduc/API/ADK/google-calendar-agent
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -c "
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os
   load_dotenv()
   scopes = os.getenv('SCOPES', '')
   print('‚úÖ Chat scopes:' if 'chat' in scopes else '‚ùå Missing chat scopes')
   print(scopes)
   "
   ```

2. **Google Chat API Access:**
   - Make sure you **re-authorized** in AgentSpace after updating OAuth scopes
   - Check that Google Chat permissions were granted in the consent screen

3. **Message Timing:**
   - Messages must be within **last 7 days**
   - Try sending fresh messages right before testing

4. **Keyword Matching:**
   - Meeting title: `"Test ADK Meeting"`
   - Space name: `"Test ADK"` 
   - Message: `"Looking forward to the Test ADK meeting"`

### **Issue: OAuth Permissions**

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Re-run the OAuth patch script
cd /Users/anhduc/API/ADK/google-calendar-agent
./scripts/patch_oauth_with_chat.sh

# Then re-authorize in AgentSpace
```

## üìã **Expected Output**

When working correctly, you should see in the meeting brief:

```markdown
## üí¨ Google Chat Context

**Spaces involved**: ADK Project Planning
**Recent Messages**: 3 messages in the last 7 days

### Key Discussion Points:
- Meeting preparation and timeline discussion
- Presentation planning
- Requirements review

### Recent Updates:
- Team is ready for the meeting
- Presentation materials being prepared

**Message Timeline**:
- **User 1**: Ready for the ADK project planning meeting? _(in ADK Project Planning)_
- **User 2**: Yes, let's discuss the timeline and requirements. _(in ADK Project Planning)_
```

## üéØ **Pro Tips**

1. **Use Descriptive Meeting Titles**: Include project names, team names, or key topics
2. **Match Space Names**: Make space names contain meeting keywords  
3. **Send Recent Messages**: Chat within 24 hours of testing for best results
4. **Include Keywords**: Mention meeting topics in chat messages
5. **Test with DMs**: Direct messages are always checked regardless of name matching

Try this setup and let me know if the Google Chat analysis appears in your meeting brief!
